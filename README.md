## Hi there, I'm Julian👋

📍 I'm a 19 year old male who is based in Hamburg, Germany. I do speak English, German and a bit of Spanish. 
⚡ Fun fact: Both of my parents are from Ecuador, a Country in South America.

🌱 I'm still going to school and trying to get my 'Abitur' school certification. 
🚀 I'm currently learning how to code the languages HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, or at least trying to learn to code generally.

💬 If there are any questions about my future projects, which I will upload, don't hesitate; I would appreciate help also.
